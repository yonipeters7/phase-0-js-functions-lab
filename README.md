Sure! Here are two additional functions that add a bit more complexity while still being suitable for new students:

**Lab: Functions in JavaScript**

**Estimate Completed Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Overview:**
You are working as a junior developer at a company that builds tools for managing personal budgets. Your task is to create a set of basic functions to perform common calculations related to budgeting. This lab will help you practice defining and using functions in JavaScript.

**Tools and Resources:**
- VSCode
- GitHub repository https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-js-functions-lab.git
- Refer to previous lessons on JavaScript functions if needed

**Instructions:**

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   - Fork the provided GitHub repository to your own account.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Create Functions:**
   - **Function 1: `calculateTax`**
     - Create a function named `calculateTax` that takes a single parameter, `amount`, representing a monetary value.
     - The function should calculate a 10% tax on the amount and return the tax value.

   - **Function 2: `convertToUpperCase`**
     - Create a function named `convertToUpperCase` that takes a single parameter, `text`, which is a string.
     - The function should convert the string to uppercase and return the result.

   - **Function 3: `findMaximum`**
     - Create a function named `findMaximum` that takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, which are numbers.
     - The function should return the larger of the two numbers.

   - **Function 4: `isPalindrome`**
     - Create a function named `isPalindrome` that takes a single parameter, `word`, which is a string.
     - The function should return `true` if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), and `false` otherwise.

   - **Function 5: `calculateDiscountedPrice`**
     - Create a function named `calculateDiscountedPrice` that takes two parameters: `originalPrice` and `discountPercentage`.
     - The function should calculate and return the price after applying the discount. For example, if `originalPrice` is $100 and `discountPercentage` is 20, the function should return $80.

4. **Test Your Functions:**
   - Run the tests provided in the repository to ensure your functions work as expected. The tests will check the correctness of your implementations.

5. **Submit Your Work:**
   - Once your functions are implemented and pass all tests, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository on GitHub.

**Submission and Grading Criteria:**

- **Submission Format:** Submit a link to your GitHub repository.
- **Grading Criteria:**
  - Correct implementation of each function (`calculateTax`, `convertToUpperCase`, `findMaximum`, `isPalindrome`, and `calculateDiscountedPrice`).
  - Functions should handle typical input values correctly.
  - Code should be clean and follow JavaScript conventions.
